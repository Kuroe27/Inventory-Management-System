Lomi Inventory Management System
This project aims to develop and implement a digital inventory management system for "Bundatan" Lomi House, a popular eatery in Batangas, Philippines. The current traditional method of inventory management used by the eatery is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks efficiency. The proposed system will provide a simple and effective solution to manage inventories, streamline ordering processes, and reduce supply wastage.

Purpose and Description
The purpose of this project is to improve the overall efficiency of inventory management at "Bundatan" Lomi House. The current manual inventory tracking method is slow and error-prone. The proposed inventory management system will automate inventory tracking, simplify ordering processes, and provide accurate sales reports.

Objectives
The main objectives of the Lomi Inventory Management System are as follows:

Develop and implement an inventory management system to efficiently manage inventory stock.
Streamline the process of inventory management, reducing the need for manual tracking.
Improve profitability by minimizing inventory wastage and providing sales data to identify best-selling items.
Scope and Limitations
The scope of this project is limited to the development and implementation of the inventory management system for "Bundatan" Lomi House. The system focuses on inventory management and does not include additional functionalities such as a Point of Sales (POS) system, marketing, sales, or financial management.

While the system allows for the changing of measurement units for ingredients, it does not automatically convert the measurement quantities when a different unit is selected. The user must manually adjust the ingredient quantities to ensure accurate recipe measurements.

Another limitation is that the system does not allow the deletion of tables with foreign key references. This restriction ensures data integrity and prevents inconsistencies in the database.

Please note that this inventory management system is not perfect and may have some flaws that could hinder its effectiveness. However, it serves as a valuable tool for "Bundatan" Lomi House to improve their inventory management process and overall efficiency.
